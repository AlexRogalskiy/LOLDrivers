  Description: "SentinelOne has observed prominent threat actors abusing legitimately\
    \ signed Microsoft drivers in active intrusions into telecommunication, BPO, MSSP,\
    \ and financial services businesses.\nInvestigations into these intrusions led\
    \ to the discovery of POORTRY and STONESTOP malware, part of a small toolkit designed\
    \ to terminate AV and EDR processes.\nWe first reported our discovery to Microsoft\u2019\
    s Security Response Center (MSRC) in October 2022 and received an official case\
    \ number (75361). Today, MSRC released an associated advisory under ADV220005.\n\
    This research is being released alongside Mandiant, a SentinelOne technology and\
    \ incident response partner. "
