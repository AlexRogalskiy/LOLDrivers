  Description: The driver in Micro-Star MSI Afterburner 4.6.2.15658 (aka RTCore64.sys
    and RTCore32.sys) allows any authenticated user to read and write to arbitrary
    memory, I/O ports, and MSRs. This can be exploited for privilege escalation, code
    execution under high privileges, and information disclosure. These signed drivers
    can also be used to bypass the Microsoft driver-signing policy to deploy malicious
    code.
  Usecase: Elevate privileges
  Privileges: kernel
  OperatingSystem: Windows 10
