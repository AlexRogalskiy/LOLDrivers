# Living Off the Land Drivers 

`LOLDrivers` Living Off the Land Drivers is a curated list of Windows drivers that malicious actors can use to bypass security and carry out attacks on target systems. These drivers are commonly used by attackers to escalate privileges, disable security controls, and execute malicious code with minimal detection. By listing these drivers and providing relevant details, Living Off the Land Drivers aims to help security professionals and system administrators stay informed and mitigate potential threats. Whether you're a security researcher, incident responder, or IT professional, this project can help you stay ahead of emerging threats and protect your systems against cyber attacks.
